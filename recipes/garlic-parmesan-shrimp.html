    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious crispy shrimp coated in a bread 
        crumb-Parmesan mixture. My family can't get enough 
        of it! I would suggest doubling the recipe if you 
        have very large eaters because this is addictive! 
        Serve with pasta and salad.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        <li>1 Â½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees 
            C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass casserole dish 
            with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, parsley,
             and garlic powder in a large resealable 
             plastic bag. Seal and shake to mix ingredients
              together. Add shrimp and shake to coat.</li>
        <li>Lay shrimp flat in the prepared baking dish. 
            Sprinkle with any bread crumb mixture 
            remaining in the bag. Drizzle melted butter 
            over the top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until starting to 
            crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Switch to broil 
            setting until topping is light brown, 2 to 3 
            minutes.</li>
    </ol>
